Hello, my name is Elliot. I am currently studying Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University. I am interested in emerging aerospace technology, such as additive manufacturing, airpower teaming, and spacecraft miniaturization, with a particular interest in defense and national security applications. My hobbies include cycling, spending time in nature, and history. A fun fact about me is I hold a Part 107 remote pilot certification from the FAA.
